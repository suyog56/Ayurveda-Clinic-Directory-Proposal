 Niche Industry Research â€“ Digital Gap &amp; Solution
## ðŸ§­ Purpose

This project explores the digital visibility gap in the Ayurvedic healthcare sector, especially in rural and semi-urban India. It aims to identify why small clinics are underrepresented online, how it impacts patients and practitioners, and proposes a user-friendly platform that could bridge this gap.

The goal is to showcase how data, product thinking, and digital innovation can drive meaningful change in traditional health sectors.
